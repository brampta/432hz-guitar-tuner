    <h2>Why tune in 432Hz?</h2>
    <p>If musical performances were to sound the same the world over, some standardization was required. As early as 1885, the Music Commission of the Italian Government declared that all instruments and orchestras should use a tuning fork that vibrated at 440 Hz, which was different from the original standard of 435 Hz and the competing 432 Hz used in France.</p>
    <p>In 1917, the American Federation of Musicians endorsed the Italians, followed by a further push for 440 Hz in the 1940s.</p>
    <p>In 1953, a worldwide agreement was signed. Signatories declared that middle “A” on the piano be forevermore tuned to exactly 440 Hz. This frequency became the standard ISO-16 reference for tuning all musical instruments based on the chromatic scale, the one most often used for music in the West. All the other notes are tuned in standard mathematical ratios leading to and from 440 Hz.</p>
    <p>This tone standard is now universally accepted, which is why a piano in Toronto sounds exactly the same as a piano in China.</p>
    <p>Weirdly, no one can say for sure why this frequency was chosen in the first place. In fact, there those among us who vehemently disagree with this standard. In fact, they consider the 440 Hz middle “A” to be an abomination against nature.</p>
    <p>Adherents to this theory claim that a more “natural” frequency for middle “A” is 438 Hz. Others believe that the correct middle “A” is 432 Hz (also known as Verdi’s A) because it has “a pure tone of math fundamental to nature” and is “mathematically consistent with the patterns of the universe, vibrating with Phi, the Golden Ratio. They point to how this pitch can be connected to everything from nautilus shells to the works of the ancients, including the construction of the Great Pyramid.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, 432 Hz resonates with 8 Hz (the Schumann Resonance), the documented fundamental electromagnetic “beat” of Earth. It just feels better.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>Here’s where the conspiracy comes in. There is allegedly something sinister and evil about 440 Hz. It is said that the Rockefeller Foundation had an interest in making sure the United States adopted the 440 Hz standard in 1935 as part of a “war on consciousness” leading to “musical cult control.”</p>
    <p>Without going too far down this rat hole, this theory says that tuning all music to 440 Hz turns it into a military weapon.</p>

    <br>
    <p><img src="assets/images/432.deagan.jpg" style="float:right;">The real music conspiracy story begins in 1910 when a man named John Calhoun Deagan [right], an alleged member of the US Naval Intelligence which was funded by the Rothschilds through their agents in the Rockefeller family, joined the American Federation of Musicians and convinced the group to endorse a standard of 440 Hz tuning for all orchestras and concert performing musicians. He was successful but this standard only applied to public performances in America.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>The Rockefeller's had only limited success with the introduction of so-called "racial hygiene laws" (one law actually passed in the state of Virginia). The American public was apprehensive about this idea as many impoverished people and certain racial types were included in the "inferior" category and slated for elimination. What they needed was a vehicle to convey their grand ideas to the common man.</p>
    <p> At about this same time, Thomas Edison had invented the phonograph and cinemas were beginning to show films made with soundtracks, both live and recorded. The potential to utilize sound as a propaganda tool was quickly realized and General Electric (Edison's new company) received large grants from the Rockefellers to develop this. They also funded acoustic research through the U.S. Naval and National Defense Research Council geared at finding ways to alter the emotions through music. They were especially interested in the ability to create mass hysteria and interviewed families who had been driven to a frenzy by Orson Wells' broadcast of War of The Worlds. They realized the potential that audio and music could have on the human psyche and incorporated these ideas in their plan for global mind control.</p>
    <p>Because the phonograph records and "talking" movies were produced in America, these new technologies were forced to comply with the American Federation of Music's 440 Hz tuning standard. Soon a slew of propaganda films were shown in Edison's theaters before and after the main features and surveys were conducted to determine the emotional effectiveness of the musical soundtracks.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the 1930s, the potential of 440 Hz to combat altruism and stimulate nationalism, narcissism and aggression was fueled by the new science of Psychology. Freud's psychoanalysis in Europe was mainly for the elite but his theories of mass hysteria found their way to America through his nephew, Edward Bernays, who successfully used Freud's theories and mind control techniques in advertising and politics. He was the first to note that only about 8-10% of a population needed to be convinced of a new idea for it to eventually become unanimously accepted. This has been called the "10% Solution".</p>
    <h4>The Nazi Connection</h4>
    <p>The Rockefeller Foundation was anxious to apply these new mind control techniques on a global scale. Together with the Rothschild's and global bankers they approached the German minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, who was already utilizing many of Bernays' advertising ideas to promote the Nazi Party.</p>
    <p><img src="assets/images/432.goebbels.jpg" style="float:right;">With their support, and with the reminder that the British were heavily in debt to their banks, the Illuminati sponsored Goebbels to promote the adoption of the 440 Hz standard by the British Standards Institute which would apply to all musicians playing in Europe. This measure reluctantly passed in 1939 despite being three months after Hitler invaded Poland. Technically, Germany had started WWII and was an axis of Britain, but this had little impact on their ultimate decision.</p>
